## 2024-05-23 - React Scripts 5 and Test Environment Complexity
**Learning:** `react-scripts` v5 is notoriously difficult to configure for testing when the default setup is broken or when newer libraries (like `react-router-dom` v7 or `tailwindcss` v4) are introduced. Attempting to force configuration overrides via `jest.config.js` or `package.json` often conflicts with the locked-down environment.
**Action:** When facing persistent test environment issues in a legacy `react-scripts` project, prioritize verification via `pnpm build` (to check compilation) and end-to-end/integration tests (like Playwright or manual verification) over fighting the unit test runner configuration, unless ejecting is a viable option. For dependencies, stick to versions known to be compatible with the CRA ecosystem (e.g., `react-router-dom` v6, `tailwindcss` v3).
